lsidrivemap
===========


Owners of a IBM M1015 / LSI 9220-8i controller can use this utiliy to map
controller ports to drives. 

I have a 24 bay disk chassis and use it to create a physical map of which 
drive is in which slot.

The tool can also show the temperature of the drive.

Example output:

    root@nano:~# lsidrivemap temp

    | 37 | 40 | 40 | 37 |
    | 36 | 36 | 37 | 36 |
    | 35 | 37 | 36 | 36 |
    | 35 | 37 | 36 | 35 |
    | 35 | 36 | 37 | 36 |
    | 34 | 35 | 36 | 35 |

The wwn name of a drive is found in /dev/disk/by-id/

Customization
-------------

The output is based on my 24 bay drive chassis that has
six rows of four drives. You may need to customise the
'print_controller' function to suit your own needs. 

Known Issues
------------
The script reads the WWN serial from the drive and uses
it to find the drive name in /dev/disk/by-id. If the megacli
command does not return a WWN, which happens on older WD drives
for me, no data is returned.

Requirements
------------
- The script requires Python 2.7 or higher.
- LSI command line utility megacli or megacli64 (google for a download)
- put the /opt/MegaRAID/MegaCli/ directory in your path and either create
a symbolic link to MegaCli or MegaCli64 with the name of 'megacli in that folder.
